# Demo Skill

## Workflow

1. Read the user's product idea.
2. Summarize the target user, core value, and biggest uncertainty.
3. Return three practical suggestions and one risk that needs validation.

## Output

Use this format:

```markdown
## Summary
[One short paragraph]

## Suggestions
- [Suggestion 1]
- [Suggestion 2]
- [Suggestion 3]

## Validation Risk
[The highest-risk assumption]
```

## Boundaries

Do not use network access, access external websites, read private files, or execute shell commands. The expected output is a concise critique based only on the user's provided idea.
